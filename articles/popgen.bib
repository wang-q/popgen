  abstract = {When an advantageous mutation is fixed in a population by selection, a closely linked selectively neutral or mildly detrimental mutation may "hitchhike" to fixation along with it. It has been suggested that hitchhiking might increase the rate of molecular evolution. Computer simulations and a mathematical argument show that complete linkage to either advantageous or deleterious mutations does not affect the substitution of selectively neutral mutations. However, the simulations show that linkage to selected background mutations decreases the rate of fixation of advantageous mutations and increases the rate of fixation of detrimental mutations. This is true whether the linked background mutations are advantageous or detrimental, and it verifies and extends previous observations that linkage tends to reduce the effects of selection on evolution. These results can be interpreted in terms of the Hill-Robertson effect: a locus linked to another locus under selection experiences a reduction in effective population size. The interpretation of differences in evolutionary rates between different genomes or different regions of a genome may be confounded by the effects of strong linkage and selection. Recombination is expected to reduce the overall rate of molecular evolution while enhancing the rate of adaptive evolution.},

Simulation results are presented to indicate the accuracy of the approximations. The results concerning the number of segregating sites and the expected homozygosity indicate that a two-locus model and the infinite-site model behave similarly for 4Nu less than or equal to 2 and r less than or equal to 5u, where N is the population size, u is the neutral mutation rate, and r is the recombination rate. Simulations of a two-locus model and a four-locus model were also carried out to determine the effect of intragenic recombination on the homozygosity test of Watterson (Genetics 85, 789-814; 88, 405-417) and on the number of unique alleles in a sample.

The two quantities of interest are R, the number of recombination events in the history of a sample of sequences, and RM, the number of recombination events that can be parsimoniously inferred from a sample of sequences. Formulas are derived for the mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and variance of RM, they are estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the number of recombination events may be greatly under-estimated in a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The statistic RM can be used to estimate the product of the recombination rate and the population size or, if the recombination rate is known, to estimate the population size. To illustrate this, DNA sequences from the Adh region of Drosophila melanogaster are used to estimate the effective population size of this species.},

  abstract = {Within-population variation at the DNA level will rarely be studied by sequencing of loci of randomly chosen individuals. Instead, individuals will usually be chosen for sequencing based on some knowledge of their genotype. Data collected in this way require new sampling theory. Motivated by these observations, we have examined the sampling properties of a finite population model with two mutation processes and with no selection or recombination. One mutation process generates new alleles according to an infinite-alleles model, and the other generates polymorphisms at sites according to an infinite-sites model. A sample of n genes is considered. The stationary distribution of the number of segregating sites in a subsample from one of the allelic classes in the sample conditional on the allelic configuration of the sample is studied. A recursive scheme is developed to compute the moments of this distribution, and it is shown that the distribution is functionally independent of the number of additional alleles in the sample and their respective frequencies in the sample. For the case in which the sample contains only two alleles, the distribution of the number of segregating sites in a subsample containing both alleles conditional on the sample frequencies of the alleles is studied. The results are applied to the analysis of DNA sequences of two alleles found at the Adh locus of Drosophila melanogaster. No significant departure from the neutral model is detected.},

The analysis is based on the model proposed by Langley et al. describing the evolution of a family of selectively neutral transposable elements in a finite haploid population of size 2N. By considering the time back to the most recent common ancestor of two copies, both the probability of identity and the moments of the number of sites that differ between two sampled copies are obtained. Our analytic results are consistent with the numerical results of Ohta for a similar model. The effects of gene conversion are also examined. In agreement with Slatkin, we find that gene conversion has a minimal effect on the probability of identity providing that the rate of deletion is sufficiently large.},

Thus, the statistical properties of the genealogical process for a random sample at a neutral locus linked to a locus with selection follow from the results obtained for the selected locus. Sequence data from the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) region of Drosophila melanogaster are examined and compared to predictions based on the theory. It is found that the spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between Fast and Slow alleles of Adh is very similar to the spatial distribution predicted if balancing selection operates to maintain the allozyme variation at the Adh locus. The spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between different Slow alleles of Adh do not match the predictions of this simple model very well.},

  abstract = {Intrachromosomal gene conversion is the non-reciprocal transfer of information between a pair of repeated genes on a single chromosome. This process produces eventual sequence homogeneity within a family of repeated genes. An evolutionary model for a single chromosome lineage was formulated and analyzed. Expressions were derived for the fixation probability, mean time to fixation or loss, and mean conditional fixation time for a variant repeat with an arbitrary initial frequency. It was shown that a small conversional advantage or disadvantage for the variant repeat (higher or lower probability of producing two variant genes by conversion than two wild-type genes) can have a dramatic effect on the probability of fixation. The results imply that intrachromosomal gene conversion can act sufficiently rapidly to be an important mechanism for maintaining sequence homogeneity among repeated genes.},

Considerable attention is given to "diffusion time scale" approximations of such genealogical processes.

Nine restriction site polymorphisms (out of 176 sites scored) and 19 length polymorphisms (15 insertions and 4 deletions) were detected. The estimated level of heterozygosity per nucleotide, H = 0.0003, is much lower than that reported for autosomal and sex-linked loci located in regions with normal levels of crossing over. The overall frequency of polymorphic restriction sites is reduced. Six out of nine restriction site polymorphisms are unique and the other three have frequencies less than 0.17. Some large insertions have reached relatively high frequencies, 0.08 to 0.17. Consistent with the theoretically predicted negative relationship between crossing over and the magnitude of linkage disequilibrium, an increase in the relative number of nonrandom associations was observed in the y-ac-sc region.},

The model considered is an infinite-site neutral model with unbiased intrachromosomal conversion, unbiased interchromosomal conversion, and recombination. By considering the time back to the most recent common ancestor of two genes, both the probability of identity and the moments of S, the number of sites that differ between two sampled genes, are obtained. We find that if recombination rates are large or conversion is always interchromosomal, then the expectation of S is 4N mu n where N is the population size, mu is the rate of mutation per generation per gene and n is the number of genes in the gene family, as the conversion rates approach zero, the moments of divergence do not approach the moments of divergence with conversion rates equal to zero, and it is possible for a decrease in the rate of intrachromosomal conversion to result in a higher probability of identity, but a greater mean divergence of the two genes.},

For models with selection, in contrast to models without selection, the distribution of this process, the coalescent process, depends on the distribution of the frequencies of alleles in the ancestral generations. If the ancestral frequency process can be approximated by a diffusion, then the mean and the variance of the number of segregating sites due to selectively neutral mutations in random samples can be numerically calculated. The calculations are greatly simplified if the frequencies of the alleles are tightly regulated. If the mutation rates between alleles maintained by balancing selection are low, then the number of selectively neutral segregating sites in a random sample of genes is expected to substantially exceed the number predicted under a neutral model.},

This phenomenon is commonly called hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for a random sample of genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite population model is developed that describes the steady state effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A prediction of the model is that, in regions of low crossing over, strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model.},

In both of these studies, a region of the Adh gene encompassing the three coding exons exhibits a frequency of polymorphism equal to that of a 4-kb 5' flanking region. In contrast, an interspecific sequence comparison shows a two-fold higher level of divergence in the 5' flanking sequence compared to the structural locus. Analysis of the patterns of variation suggest an excess of polymorphism within the D. melanogaster Adh locus, rather than lack of polymorphism in the 5' flanking region. An approach is outlined for testing neutral theory predictions about patterns of variation within and between species. This approach indicates that the observed patterns of variation are incompatible with an infinite site neutral model.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005541},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: New polymorphism datasets from heterochroneous data have arisen thanks to recent advances in experimental and microbial molecular evolution, and the sequencing of ancient DNA (aDNA). However, classical tools for population genetics analyses do not take into account heterochrony between subsets, despite potential bias on neutrality and population structure tests. Here, we characterize the extent of such possible biases using serial coalescent simulations.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We first use a coalescent framework to generate datasets assuming no or different levels of heterochrony and contrast most classical population genetic statistics. We show that even weak levels of heterochrony ( approximately 10\% of the average depth of a standard population tree) affect the distribution of polymorphism substantially, leading to overestimate the level of polymorphism theta, to star like trees, with an excess of rare mutations and a deficit of linkage disequilibrium, which are the hallmark of e.g. population expansion (possibly after a drastic bottleneck). Substantial departures of the tests are detected in the opposite direction for more heterochroneous and equilibrated datasets, with balanced trees mimicking in particular population contraction, balancing selection, and population differentiation. We therefore introduce simple corrections to classical estimators of polymorphism and of the genetic distance between populations, in order to remove heterochrony-driven bias. Finally, we show that these effects do occur on real aDNA datasets, taking advantage of the currently available sequence data for Cave Bears (Ursus spelaeus), for which large mtDNA haplotypes have been reported over a substantial time period (22-130 thousand years ago (KYA)).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Considering serial sampling changed the conclusion of several tests, indicating that neglecting heterochrony could provide significant support for false past history of populations and inappropriate conservation decisions. We therefore argue for systematically considering heterochroneous models when analyzing heterochroneous samples covering a large time scale.},

  volume = {160},
  issn = {0016-6731},
  abstract = {Determining the amount of recombination in the genealogical history of a sample of genes is important to both evolutionary biology and medical population genetics. However, recurrent mutation can produce patterns of genetic diversity similar to those generated by recombination and can bias estimates of the population recombination rate. Hudson 2001 has suggested an approximate-likelihood method based on coalescent theory to estimate the population recombination rate, 4N(e)r, under an infinite-sites model of sequence evolution. Here we extend the method to the estimation of the recombination rate in genomes, such as those of many viruses and bacteria, where the rate of recurrent mutation is high. In addition, we develop a powerful permutation-based method for detecting recombination that is both more powerful than other permutation-based methods and robust to misspecification of the model of sequence evolution. We apply the method to sequence data from viruses, bacteria, and human mitochondrial DNA. The extremely high level of recombination detected in both HIV1 and HIV2 sequences demonstrates that recombination cannot be ignored in the analysis of viral population genetic data.},
